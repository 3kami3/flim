* You should byte-compile(make).
Because DOODLE uses very complex macro.

Especialy ew-line.el, ew-scan-m.el, ew-scan-s.el and ew-scan-u.el that
are require 'lex.
(lex is scanner generator.)

* Multiline field-bodies fetched from XOVER is already unfolded,
so special care is needed for gnus-structured-field-decoder and
gnus-unstructured-field-decoder.

(autoload 'ew-gnus-structured-field-decoder "ew-compat")
(setq gnus-structured-field-decoder 'ew-gnus-structured-field-decoder)

(autoload 'ew-gnus-unstructured-field-decoder "ew-compat")
(setq gnus-unstructured-field-decoder 'ew-gnus-unstructured-field-decoder)

* Ignore warnings about args-eword-* when byte-compiling.

* If you want to modify load-path or other variables when
byte-compiling without editing files, set EVALARGS environment variable.

  % EVALARGS='(setq load-path (cons "../apel" load-path))' make

* You should byte-compile(make).
Because DOODLE uses very complex macro.

Especialy ew-line.el, ew-scan-m.el, ew-scan-s.el and ew-scan-u.el that are require 'lex.
(lex is scanner generator.)

* Multiline field-bodies fetched from XOVER is already concatinated,
you should set ew-ignore-76bytes-limit to true.

(setq gnus-unstructured-field-decoder
  (lambda (string)
    (let ((ew-ignore-76bytes-limit t))
      (eword-decode-unstructured-field-body
        (std11-unfold-string string)
        (quote must-unfold)))))

(setq gnus-structured-field-decoder
  (lambda (string)
    (let ((ew-ignore-76bytes-limit t))
      (eword-decode-and-unfold-structured-field string))))

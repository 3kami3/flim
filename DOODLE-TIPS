* You should byte-compile(make).
Because DOODLE uses very complex macro.

Especialy ew-line.el, ew-scan-m.el, ew-scan-s.el and ew-scan-u.el that are require 'lex.
(lex is scanner generator.)

* Multiline field-bodies fetched from XOVER is already concatinated,
you should set ew-ignore-76bytes-limit to true.
Currentry Gnus use these variables to decode and "Subject" and "From",
tell it here. Unless doing it, DOODLE does not decode atoms in phrase
because DOODLE cannot decide whether an atom is in phrase or not without
field name information.

(setq gnus-unstructured-field-decoder
  (lambda (string)
    (let ((ew-ignore-76bytes-limit t))
      (ew-cut-cr-lf (ew-decode-field "Subject" (ew-lf-to-crlf string))))))

(setq gnus-structured-field-decoder
  (lambda (string)
    (let ((ew-ignore-76bytes-limit t))
      (ew-cut-cr-lf (ew-decode-field "From" (ew-lf-to-crlf string))))))
